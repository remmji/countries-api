# countries-api
Fully Responsive REST Countries API with color theme switcher

Project made in React with usage of styled-components and framer-motion.

Working functionalities: 
•Search 
•Region Filter 
•Dark mode / Light mode 
•Dynamic links on border buttons in detailed country page.
•Google Maps link for every country

The most challenging part was setting up proper structure so i could send data and set router for mentioned dynamic links. 
I'm aware it could have been done better perhaps by consolidating detailed page and border country page in one component instead two,
but i followed my initial approach to return data from API which i believed was most effective.
Overall, the project was more challenging than I expected and provided very valuable training on API, router, and data passing.
